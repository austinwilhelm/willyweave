chaos amidst chaos  
manufactured unruliness  
leave it be, let the organic nature flow  
  
anxieties and unbridled fear being stoked  
fragmented, divided, and isolated  
we lack the fresh, empowering connections  
  
the organic and alive,  
the unbounded and raw,  
an unexpected outcome within a wondering awe
