i have a habit  
of getting consumed by worlds only written  
whether told in story or song  
attachments to characters and moments  
that i'll never see touch reality  
  
such magic envelops me each and every time  
to rebel, to fight, to live, to breathe  
i hold the inspiration as such a tangible feeling  
so what else can do   
except drift off to a new world in my mind
