plans within plans within plans  
the peaks alongside the valleys of life  
the constant string of life  
pulling us along the universal timeline  

maybe we were wrong about time  
about seconds and money measuring worth  
instead of the unconditional love  
the intangibility that brings meaning and warmth  
worth it's weight in imaginary gold
