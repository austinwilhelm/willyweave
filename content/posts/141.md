we're a lot alike you know  
thinking, thinking about thinking   
that little voice in your head that reads these words off the screen  
  
yet everything we know, we must detach from  
the "I" must detach from itself  
subatomic metacognition, thinking about thinking about thinking
  
and then,
bliss, oneness, infinity
