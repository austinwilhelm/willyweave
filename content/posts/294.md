caught in a blend of realities  
timelines that only ever existed  
within the fabric of my imagination  
so maybe they did, in fact, exist  
who is to say   
  
nostalgia is a form factor easily succumbed to  
the comfort of familiarity  
a sad, yet sweet aura  
smooth and buttery, yet soul crushing  
making you yearn for a life never lived
