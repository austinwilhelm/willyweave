hello friend    
you're just like me huh  
trapped in these thought spirals  
day after day, minute by minute  
  
one second you're here  
the next you're gone  
in some other world  
dissimilar from our own  
  
the 1-2-3s, the counting, the noting  
it can all help  
but befriend that loud voice  
the one that carries you away  
  
a certain mystical sense about it  
like when? or how? or even, why?  
be kind, my mind  
for I am just here to exist and observe
