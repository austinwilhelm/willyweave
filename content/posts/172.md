the small one, the weak one  
the wallflower of our solar system  
some say you don't matter  
with all that matter  
but I say you do  
  
you see, you're still a rocky mass  
a sight to behold  
if you had an atmosphere  
I'm sure it would have worked  
though none of us can be too sure  
  
to me you're still a planet  
existing and floating through time  
remind us that you're there  
give us a ring sometime  
& we'll catch you on the next revolution
