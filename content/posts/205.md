what kind of path lies ahead  
the one question on my mind  
hit with the aromatic innocence  
yet the powerful magnetism draws me in  
  
the sensitive ones, the feelers  
you soft, yet nimble being  
keeps me exploring and digging  
what kind of beauty lurks below as above  
  
what have I stumbled upon  
which path led me to you  
to which steps do I have to thank  
what kind of story have we found ourselves in?
