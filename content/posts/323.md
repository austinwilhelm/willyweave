ambient synths encho down hallways  
quiet chatter in a vaunted coffee shop  
as we grow further and further apart  
time drifts ever onward  
  
*one day*, we both say  
one day we'll hangout  
one day we'll catch up  
one day  
  
us two stars  
just weren't meant  
to exist so close  
for this long
