time and tide wait for no man  
we're all passing through life on this rock  
devouring and learning our own meanings  
each to the same inevitable end   
  
who am I to judge myself  
for trying, being, existing  
only one shot we get, in this little life  
this speck of time on an infinite canvas of existence
