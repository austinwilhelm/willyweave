to be in lockstep  
more than passing gazes  
inextricably linked, unmoving  
  
not as a duty or an obligation  
but as discovery, curiosity, passion  
a wanting to be caught in the throes of a divine world  
  
I may not know you yet  
it may be some time along this golden path  
but here I journey, and here I remain
