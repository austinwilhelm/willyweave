oh that happened  
he said she said  
this was two days ago  
sent but no reply  
a mess here, a mess there  
lists that get written  
but never completed  
thoughts pile up like clothes  
actions taken yet conscious lags  
all happening so fast, a blur, a rush  
  
going through the motions  
slogging through it all  
a throughline without emotion   
present but not feeling  
what is a life without feeling
