not a problem to solve  
but a thing to experience  
an uncharted territory  
no map, but all possibilities exist  
a quantum reality of optimism  
  
the comforting bliss  
silence that quenches, not yearns  
purpose and intention intertwined  
a destiny of paths crossing  
where are we, and what will we become  
  
I don't know what it is
