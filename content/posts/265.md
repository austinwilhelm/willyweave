commotion and energy, colliding and surfacing  
humans hanging on every last drop and fragrance  
empty chairs and signs of life  
a ghost of conversations past  
  
the face of someone I once knew in another life  
smile warm to the touch inside of us   
like hello fellow being  
i'm just happy you exist  
  
yet someone always leaves me  
leaves me attached, wanting  
wanting that connection, hanging on  
hanging on for dear, life
