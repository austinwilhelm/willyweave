the longest of journeys  
requires that first single step  
whether solid or quicksand  
one must adjust and continue  
  
no daring to be great  
a sight to be unbeheld  
simply to exist  
and to adjourn  
  
a full revolution  
the taking back  
ceasing the opportunity  
to weave in this wild world
