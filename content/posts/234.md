deep breath in  
a settling peace, like wind erasing dust  
the rain cleanses the earth   
a new beginning, a fresh start  
  
an exhale to release  
oxygen fuels flames of retreat  
the burning heat, scorching the roots and greens  
a new beginning all the same  
  
some endings and beginnings  
are just different  
the same, yes  
but different
