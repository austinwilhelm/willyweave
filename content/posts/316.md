what distracts you?  
unmeasured things  
pulling you off the stage of life  
where does your mind go to?  
bring it here  
  
our perception, our awareness  
scattered and plotted  
in many different directions, things, ways  
what truly distracts you?  
return here  
  
is it worry, fear?  
lost in a daydream, future unclear  
or a panic of a past mistake  
any which way it pulls you  
bring it all back to you  
  
mind where your feet are
