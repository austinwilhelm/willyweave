what a strange and wonderful place  
care to stop to smell the roses  
or wait for the next wave to ride off on   
  
you see  
there are possibilities worth discovering  
if you're able to escape the mind trap  
  
move, act, try something new  
be bold, be couragous, be mindful  
be and you'll see
