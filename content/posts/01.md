for all things preposterous and pronounced  
letting the wildest reaches of my imagination  
run rampant on an infinite digital canvas  
for once you've read, you cannot unread  

  
    

let each piece hit you where it must  
though I hope it soft  
these are my dreams, hopes, thoughts, joys  
for all time, always
