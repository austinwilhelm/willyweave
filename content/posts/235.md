what do you hear  
when you're alone with yourself  
is there chatter, waves of noise  
or just the sound of silence  
  
where does your wanderer go  
which paths do they wind and weave through  
your conscious being is a great servant  
but a bad master  
  
observe the observer  
watch where it goes, keep it close  
be curious of the curiosity  
staying one step ahead
