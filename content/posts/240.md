we all take strides  
from different walks of life  
differing perspectives and minds  
  
what does this mean, when we coalesce  
how we interact, how we show up  
where and when we decide to share  
  
the emotion that presents, the emotion that hides  
what pain begets pain, what joy begets joy  
how do we kiss moments goodbye, or hold on forever  
  
my pain versus your pain  
standing side by side  
what kind of pain do you hold  
inside
