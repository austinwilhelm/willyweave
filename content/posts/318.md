for generations living in fleeting moments  
we now exist in times too quickly outpacing us  
a shiny new thing, an underlying panic  
wrought to our core with distraction disease  
  
i struggle to stay present  
a livlihood of endless possitibility  
yet all that i need  
is right here with me, within ourselves
