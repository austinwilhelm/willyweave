sometimes I stumble  
on the cracks in the sidewalk  
aware that they never meant to  
but I stop to observe the greens growing through  
  
the ever-persevering life manifest  
nothing we do can ever be permanent  
nature and it's binding power is unlimited  
we're just mere observers, playing controller
