catching glances like they're drops of rain    
part of a story i'd otherwise never hear     
crossing winding paths with strangers  
a little mix of whimsy and serendipity  
  
the odds of us both making it here today  
are astronomical, to put it plainly  
how did your path meet mine in this place  
a coffee shop crush to stay
