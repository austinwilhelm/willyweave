there will be days  
days when it's murky, cloudy, dark  
days when it's hot and unbearable  
days when it's cold and unbearable  
days when you want to start  
days when you want to quit  
days when you feel on top of the world  
days when you feel as if you've ruined everything   
days when your mind is your best friend  
days when your mind is your worst enemy  
  
but one day  
one day will change all of that  
the day when it's perfect outside  
blue skies, 70Â°, a slight breeze  
  
but even still  
there will be days
