all by its lonesome, my mind runs rampant  
nothing but thoughts carry me away  
for each and every one of us  
has our own pitfalls, doubts, fears  
  
such as a cold front clears out the atmosphere  
a few utter words, mere breaths with variance  
are enough to make me forget  
make all the difference
